<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>I like solving problems, big and small. More importantly, I like finding the most elegant, creative and effective solution to a problem (perhaps this is why Design Thinking resonates with me). I’ve been like this for as long as I can remember, even as a kid working with my dad’s tools. Nowadays I use my math, engineering and software background as tools to solve problems. I have used these tools in different roles, from sales engineering, system engineering, operations, software and architect roles. There’s nothing quite like the satisfaction you get when your team solves a complex problem elegantly. This is what I like, and this is what I believe I do well.</p>

<p>Here’s an overview of my experience:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Well-rounded and can effectively adapt to different environments, concepts, and technologies.</li>
  <li>Variety of roles in software engineering/design, system/solution engineering, sales engineering, consulting, testing, and technical project management.</li>
  <li>Clear, in-depth understanding of mobile and IT network architectures.</li>
  <li>Experience with product, service, and software life cycle.</li>
  <li>Team and project leadership, with the ability to navigate complex projects.</li>
  <li>Excellent interpersonal skills within teams and with customers. I like working with people.</li>
</ul>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Brett is an API expert. He’s worked on a large number of API projects that span wide variety of domains. Few people have the breadth and depth of API experience as Brett.</p>
</blockquote>

  <p>I had the pleasure of working with Brett for more than 4 years at the AT&amp;T. As an architect and technical lead Brett's have the ability to command a room and get people on board with ideas—even people who were initially on completely different pages. As a team member or a leader, Brett earns my highest recommendation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Tish St. Germain (Product leadership throughout lifecycle. Integrator of software &amp; hardware development using Scaled Agile methodology.)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve had the pleasure of managing Brett Schwarz for the past 3 years.  Brett is passionate about good, clean, simple API Design and adherence to standards.  He regularly demonstrates his mastery of technical tools and methodologies when providing recommendations to both project and tool enhancement initiatives.  He is recognized as the lead subject matter expert at AT&amp;T on the REST protocol, responsible for approving all new API designs, writing technical blogs, as well as creating training and development tools.  Brett understands that technology changes fast and he works hard to keep his skillset up to date.  Brett would be a significant asset to any team looking to leverage or deploy API’s in their architectural designs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Karthic Raghavan (Principal Technical Architect at AT&amp;T Services Inc)</strong></p>

  <p>I have worked with Brett for the past 7-8 years, and he has always gone above and beyond what he was asked to do. He always strives to improve products, services, and processes. He has great attention to detail and does the job the right way. He is very personable and a pleasure to work with.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have come across many people who claim themselves to be an expert in REST API Design and Architecture but many of them are not even close to be an expert in it. But I can say with utmost confidence that BRETT is an TRUE expert in REST API Design and Architecture and a GURU in it. I have not come across anybody who is better than him in it in the industry till now. He is an pioneer in it working alongside with me as a co-lead in the North Bound REST API architecture for an REST API based gateway.</p>
