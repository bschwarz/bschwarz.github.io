    "summary": "I like solving problems, big and small. More importantly, I like finding the most elegant, creative and effective solution to a problem (perhaps this is why Design Thinking resonates with me). I've been like this for as long as I can remember, even as a kid working with my dad's tools. Nowadays I use my math, engineering and software background as tools to solve problems. I have used these tools in different roles, from sales engineering, system engineering, operations, software and architect roles. There's nothing quite like the satisfaction you get when your team solves a complex problem elegantly. This is what I like, and this is what I believe I do well.\n\nHere's an overview of my experience:\n\u2022 Well-rounded and can effectively adapt to different environments, concepts, and technologies.\n\u2022 Variety of roles in software engineering/design, system/solution engineering, sales engineering, consulting, \n  testing, and technical project management.\n\u2022 Clear, in-depth understanding of mobile and IT network architectures.\n\u2022 Experience with product, service, and software life cycle.\n\u2022 Team and project leadership, with the ability to navigate complex projects.\n\u2022 Excellent interpersonal skills within teams and with customers.
